## Hej 👋

I'm inspired by writing, learning languages, science, space, gamedev, web development, photography, minimalism, self-improvement, and cats.<br>
I'm in awe of everything made with love, aimed at creating something significant or making the world a better place.

Here I will post pieces of my code from my courses' practice and some of my projects when I happen to have any.

**Currently learning:**<br>
⌨️ Python<br>
💻 web development<br>
📈 basics of data analytics<br>

🌍 I speak English and Russian languages. I learn French and Swedish.
